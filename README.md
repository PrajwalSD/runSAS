# Prerequisites
SAS 9.x environment (Linux) with SAS BatchServer component is essential for the runSAS to execute or any equivalent (i.e. `sas.sh`, `sasbatch.sh` etc.) would work. The core dependencies are checked every launch of the script automatically.

# Is there a help menu?
 `./runSAS.sh --help`

# How can I see the version of the script?
 `./runSAS.sh --version`
 
# How can I update to the latest version?
 `./runSAS.sh --update`

# How to use the script?
  * Download/clone `runSAS.sh` and transfer it to the SAS server
  * Set the environment parameters (inside the script in the top section)
  * Specify the list of the job(s)/program(s) you want to run (use --prompt or -p to allow a user to skip a job in the runtime)
  * Execute the script (see the details on modes of execution below) as a user who has execution privileges (OS and SAS Metadata privileges)

# How to run the script? 
The script has multiple modes of execution, see `./runSAS.sh --help` for more details. 

* ### Non-Interactive mode
  If you want to run an end to end batch without any manual intervention.
  
  `./runSAS.sh`
  
* ### Interactive mode (-i)
  If you want to run one job at a time through the list, the script waits for you to press an enter key to continue.
  
  `./runSAS.sh -i`
  
* ### Adhoc job mode (-j)
If you want to run any deployed job which is not in the job list, you can run using this mode

`./runSAS.sh -j`
  
* ### Run upto mode (-u)
  If you want to run until a specific job, the script will run all the jobs in the list until the specified job.
  
  `./runSAS.sh -u <name or index>`
  
  *NOTE: `name` refers to the job name in the list and `index` refers to the job number (if you are lazy!), you have a choice of using     either of them during the launch the script will find the relevant job name from the list*

* ### Run from mode (-f)
  If you want to run from a specific job, the script will skip the jobs and will start running from a specified job.
  
  `./runSAS.sh -f <name or index>`
  
* ### Run a single job mode (-o)
  If you want to run a specific job, the script will skip the other jobs and will start running only the specified job.
  
  `./runSAS.sh -o <name or index>`
  
* ### Run from a job to a job mode (-fu)
  If you want to run a bunch of jobs together from one point to the other.
  
  `./runSAS.sh -fu <name or index> <name or index>` 
  
* ### Run from a job to a job interactive mode (-fui)
  If you want to run from one job to the other job, but in an interactive mode (__runs the rest__ in a non-interactive mode)  
  
  `./runSAS.sh -fui <name or index> <name or index>` 
  
* ### Run from a job to a job interactive mode (-fuis)
  If you want to run from one job to the other job, but in an interactive mode (__skips__ the rest in a non-interactive       mode)" 
  
  `./runSAS.sh -fuis <name or index> <name or index>` 
  
# Tips
 To preview the job list use `./runSAS.sh --jobs`
